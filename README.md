# Sotware Engineer Portfolio

This project was built and designed over the course of 1 and a half months to serve as my personal porfolio and also as a project to refine my proficiency with React.

The primary framework used was [React](https://reactjs.org/) for components and state management and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling

At the moment the site is complete but constant improvements are being made to better organize the code and perhaps provide functionality to use it as a template for other developers portfolios.

The site is hosted on [Github](https://austingti.github.io)
